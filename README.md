### Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG 
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Variables 'vehicle_length' and 'ground_clearance' both added non random variances to miles per gallon per the multiple linear regression formula.  The calculated p values for both variables were below the significance level of .05%.
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The multiple r-square value calculated from the multiple linear regression model is 0.7149.  Combined with the p-value below the signicance level of .05%, the null hypotheses is rejected.  As such, the slope cannot be zero. 
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The linear model predicts mpg effectively due to the multiple r-square value being 3.7149 abd the p-value being below the significance level of .05%.  See the output below.
